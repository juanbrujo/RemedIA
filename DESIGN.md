## Brand & Style

The design system is defined by an **Airy Minimalism** aesthetic blended with **Glassmorphism**. It aims to evoke a sense of limitless potential and "intellectual light," positioning the AI app-building process as effortless and premium. 

The visual language relies on heavy whitespace, soft atmospheric transitions, and high-fidelity depth. By utilizing translucent layers and oversized radii, the interface feels less like a rigid tool and more like an open, creative environment. The emotional response should be one of calm focus and sophisticated innovation.

## Colors

The color strategy for this design system utilizes a "Bright-Soft" approach. Backgrounds primarily use **Off-White (#F7F1E6)** to avoid the clinical feel of pure white, providing a warm, parchment-like canvas. 

**Warm Orange** and **Peach** serve as the primary action and energy colors, while **Pale Lime** and **Soft Cyan** act as accent highlights for AI-generated content or success states. **Pale Lavender** is reserved for deep-focus areas and subtle background depth. All colors should be used with high transparency (10-30% alpha) when creating "glassy" background blurs to maintain a sense of airiness.

## Typography

This design system employs **Plus Jakarta Sans** for its modern, rounded geometric character that bridges the gap between professional and friendly. 

The typographic hierarchy is intentionally dramatic. Headlines are oversized, set in heavy weights (Bold/ExtraBold) with tight letter-spacing to create a "Black" editorial feel. Body text remains spacious with generous line-height to ensure readability against colorful or translucent backgrounds. Use the "Label Caps" style for secondary metadata to maintain a clean, organized grid.

## Layout & Spacing

The layout philosophy follows a **Spacious Fixed Grid** model. Content is centered within a maximum width of 1440px, utilizing a 12-column structure with wide 32px gutters to prevent visual clutter.

Whitespace is treated as a first-class component. Large gaps (120px+) between major sections emphasize the "premium" nature of the product. Internal spacing within cards and containers is also generous (40px) to allow elements to breathe.

## Elevation & Depth

Depth is conveyed through **Glassmorphism** and **Atmospheric Shadows**. 

1.  **The Base Layer:** Solid Off-White or subtle atmospheric gradients.
2.  **The Floating Layer:** Large cards and containers utilize a backdrop-blur (minimum 20px) and 70-80% white opacity.
3.  **Shadow Character:** Shadows are extremely diffused, using a very low opacity (5-8%) of the Warm Orange or Soft Cyan rather than pure black. This creates a "glow" effect rather than a heavy drop.
4.  **Borders:** All containers feature a thin (1px) border in Light Gray or a slightly lighter version of the background to define edges without adding visual weight.

## Shapes

The shape language is organic and soft. To match the premium AI aesthetic, we utilize high-radius corners across all elements. 

Primary cards and containers use a **32px radius**. Interaction elements like buttons and search/prompt inputs adopt a full **Pill-shape (100px)**. This eliminates sharp corners entirely, contributing to a fluid, approachable, and high-end feel that contrasts with traditional, "boxy" SaaS tools.

## Components

### Buttons
Primary buttons are pill-shaped, using the **Warm-Sunset gradient**. They should feature a subtle "lift" hover effect. Secondary buttons are "Glassy" with a thin border and no background fill until hovered.

### Prompt Inputs
The central interaction point of the design system. These are large, pill-shaped white containers with a 1px Light-Gray border and a deep, soft shadow. Text inside should be `body-lg`.

### Cards
Large-radius (32px) containers. Most cards should use the glassy translucent effect (`backdrop-filter: blur(20px)`) to allow background gradients to peak through. Borders are thin and light.

### Chips & Tags
Small pill-shaped elements using the **Pale Lime** or **Soft Cyan** at 20% opacity with matching dark text. These are used for AI categories or status indicators.

### AI Canvas
A specialized component for the app-builder workspace featuring a "dotted" grid background in Light Gray, where floating glassy panels house the builder tools.
